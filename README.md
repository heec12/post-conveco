# post-conveco
This repository contains post-processing code for [mantle convection numerical modeling](https://github.com/bradfordjfoley/foley-convection-code) results used in Choi and Foley (2024). Most of the figures are written in Matlab, and other post-processing is based on Python. Numerical model visualization is done by Paraview (Fig 2&3) and the corresponding Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/heec12/conveco2vtk.git). Python codes are mostly self-explanatory and well-commented, but any questions regarding codes can be directed to me at hxc5400@psu.edu.
